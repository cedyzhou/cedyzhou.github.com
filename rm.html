      <p>
      Our team explored the current system for problems we could identify with it and then we make a clear list where issues arose. Also we start brainstorming ideas with the participators from busniess and market department who were users.Some of the inconsistencies and user experience issues were included as follow: </p>

      <ul class="case-list-desc">
        <li>
          <img src="img/rm/icons/Sad%20User.svg ">

          <section class="list-cnt ">
            <span class="case-list-title ">Lack of Feedback States</span>
            <p>We took notice that when interacting with different components of the UI ,there is a lack of feeback. Actions such as hovering, dropdownâ€™s, button presses, image uploads and text inputs all had no feedback hardly, which ultimately made users confused when interacting with the system.
            </p>
          </section>
        </li>

        <li>

          <section class="list-cnt">
            <span class="case-list-title ">Button/Icon Repetition & Inconsistencies</span>
            <p>Repeating buttons and icons with the same style were used throughout the interface, however, these icons/buttons performed different actions which once again was very confusing so that users had to re-learn the actions related to each button and icon in the different scenarios.A main goal was to provide a constant communication for every action that was completed.
          </section>
        </li>

        <li>

            <span class="case-list-title "> 
          Confusing Function Priority</span>
            <p>
   Some important features of the system were actually placed in the second or even third level on the menu that caused the major function not to be prominent, primary and secondary didn't divide. We intended to improve the feedback states between the system and users to correct the usability issues .

      <section class="case-cnt-right foo">
        <p>
After compiling the asset base and identifying the individual components to focus on in the interface, we were able to redesign each the sections that we focused on included:</p>

        <ul class="list-point ">
          <li>Login Area</li>
          <li>Home Dashboard</li>
          <li>Navigation</li>
          <li>Data Anlaytical Tools</li>
          <li>Campaigns Builder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Home Dashboard</h3>
        <p>The current dashboard is quite simplistic, and provides a quick overview of the number of products, stores and images within the CMS. While this quickly provides users with the most important information within the system, the dashboard could provide much more information given the large amount of unused space in the screen.</p>
      </section>
    </div>

    <section class="img-wrap img-margin foo">
      <img class="case-img" src="img/rm/RM-Home.png ">
    </section>

    <div class="wrapper case-section foo">
      <section class="case-cnt-right-extra ">
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
When updating the navigation, our team made a decision to fold the navigation on the left side of the screen using a fixed vertical navigation. When the user moves across over the navigation collapsed, it expands and shows as an overlay on the current screen. It was deliberately designed to maximize screen real estate because of the nature of the content being viewed.

        <h3>Campaign Builder</h3>
    <p>    When re-designing this section, we intended to build up a progress that incredibly simple and efficient to users to handle thorough reduce the numbers of pages that they should interact with. It is huge challenge for me to deal with the complexity and numbers of business featured.  </p><p>
The campaigner builder section allowed users to build up their campaign by muti-channel such as email, sms and different social media in a tree-form flow. The users started a campaign construction by drag or pull the progress block quickly and set up the trigger point. Finally they could find the tree-form flow to re-confirm.</p>

    <section class="case-cnt-right ">

      <p>The RImanggis took several months to complete re-design , needless to say,a quite huge and complex tool involved a lot of people.I completed a thorough analysis of part of the sections, figured out components that need to be upadated, and worked with the business &technology colleagues to confirm the demands were met. </p>
